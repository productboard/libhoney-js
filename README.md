# libhoney

> [!NOTE]
> This is stripped-down branch that only contains compiled files. The source branch is [`v3.1.1-productboard`](/../v3.1.1-productboard/).

> We created it to simplify our installation process of the patched version. This way we don't need to publish our changes to `npm` and we can depend on GH repository directly.
